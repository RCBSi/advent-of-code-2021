Day 19, Plan: 

    1. Identify stars by their local types, i.e., the distance
        and cosine to the nearest two other stars.
    Result: Success! Stars appear in clusters of 3.
    
    2. For each pair of observers who can see a triple of stars,
        use that triple to translate observations 
        from one reference frame to another. 
        
    3. Make a "reduction plan" to translate observations 
        transitively to all observations towards some
        single reference frame.
